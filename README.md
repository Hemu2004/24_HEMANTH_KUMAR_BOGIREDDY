Symptom Checker using Agentic AI (Preliminary & Non-Diagnostic)

Problem Statement : Access to timely and reliable medical guidance remains a significant challenge, especially for individuals who experience symptoms but are uncertain about their severity or next steps. Many existing symptom checker applications either provide overly generic outputs or unintentionally appear diagnostic, which can be unsafe and misleading. Additionally, most systems follow a single-step prediction approach and lack transparency in how conclusions are reached. There is a need for a safe, non-diagnostic, and explainable AI system that can assist users in understanding possible health conditions while clearly communicating uncertainty, urgency, and ethical boundaries.

Project Overview: The Agentic AI Symptom Checker* is an assessment-based AI system designed to support preliminary health awareness. It accepts user-reported symptoms, performs intelligent reasoning through multiple AI agents, and returns the top-3 most likely health conditions along with a clear explanation and risk assessment.

Objectives:

* Accept structured and unstructured symptom inputs from users
* Use machine learning to generate top-k (top-3) condition predictions
* Apply agentic reasoning to ask follow-up questions when needed
* Assess urgency levels using a hybrid of rules and model confidence
* Provide human-readable explanations using a Large Language Model (LLM)
* Enforce strict medical and ethical guardrails
